# packt_sql_training
 this is basically a collection of code that I'm writing for exercises from the book SQL for Data Analytics from Packt.
 since the book talks about using git and whatnot, I figured i'd dive headfirst into the whole schmeer.
 i don't expect i'll have much more to this readme - exercise-specific notes will be found in the various code files themselves
 feel free to take a look around, though!
