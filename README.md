# packt_sql_training
 this is basically a collection of code that I'm writing for exercises from the book SQL for Data Analytics from Packt.
 since the book talks about using git and whatnot, I figured i'd dive headfirst into the whole schmeer.
 i don't expect i'll have much more to this readme - exercise-specific notes will be found in the various code files themselves
 feel free to take a look around, though!

 # Update: 1/16/2023
 I had started this repo to basically brush up and get back up to speed on my SQL skills and to keep sort of a living record
 of what I'd been learning and re-learning. It turns out that my job served as a far better way to learn SQL than these tutorials,
 so I haven't had a need for them beyond quick references to specific functions. When I have some down time, I may come back to this 
 book and finish the lessons, but for now I'm focusing more on python/coding for ML/Data Science.
